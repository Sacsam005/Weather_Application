# WeatherCast  -  Find the weather forecast across the globe
WeatherCast is a web-based weather forecasting application created using pure JavaScript from scratch. It provides up-to-date weather information from all over the world, thanks to the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API.

### A big shout out to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) for this free and easy to use API.

List of OpenWeatherMap APIs used:
- [Current weather data](https://openweathermap.org/current)
- [Air Pollution API](https://openweathermap.org/api/air-pollution)
- [5 day / 3 hour forecast data](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5)

Things that can be considered for future iterations:
- Work with Google's JavaScript MAP API and places API for enhancements and taking this app to next level.
Need a minor alteration on the existing code to achieve this. Tried getting the API_KEY from google but failed :(.

Developer's note:
- I understand the importance of clean, well-organized code, and while this implementation is currently effective and efficient, there is always room for improvement. However, I acknowledge that the code could benefit from some organization and refactoring.
